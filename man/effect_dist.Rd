\title{Effect-size distribution for a trait}
\usage{
effect_dist(trait)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait}{Character string. The trait name.
Use [effect_dist_traits()] to see available names.}
}
\value{
A function (as returned by `mixnorm_to_scale_fam`) representing
  the trait-specific effect-size distribution.
}
\description{
Returns the mixture-Normal effect-size distribution (from `mixnorm_to_scale_fam`)
for a given trait. These are built from the 13-component mixture with
variance multipliers 2^(-7:5), using weights estimated from `ww_est.mat`.
}
\examples{
# List available traits
effect_dist_traits()

# Get BMI distribution
f <- effect_dist("Body mass index")
# Use `f` as you would with mixnorm_to_scale_fam output
}
